   <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <div class="res-table">
      <ol>
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Halve bell pepper lengthwise; remove stem and seeds. Thinly slice chives. Tear mozzarella into bite-size pieces.</li></span>
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• • Rub each bell pepper half with a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides down. • Roast on top rack until softened and lightly charred, 20-25 minutes. • Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Transfer to a cutting board, then thinly slice. • Heat broiler to high.</li></span>
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• While bell pepper roasts, place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just melted, 30 seconds. Stir in panko and season with salt.</li></span>
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Drain and set aside.</li></span>
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• While pasta cooks, heat a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add marinara, ½ cup water, half the chives, a pinch of chili flakes, and a big pinch of salt; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium. Simmer until slightly thickened, 3-5 minutes. • Turn off heat; stir in cream cheese until melted and combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>      
         <span><img src="" alt=""><li>• Stir sliced bell pepper and drained cavatappi into pan with sauce. If sauce seems too thick, add a splash of water. Season with salt and pepper. (TIP: If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture now to a baking dish.) Sprinkle with mozzarella and panko. • Broil on top rack until cheese melts and panko is golden brown, 2-4 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning. • Sprinkle with remaining chives and more chili flakes if desired. Divide between plates and serve.</li></span>
